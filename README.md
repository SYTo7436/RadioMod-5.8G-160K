# RadioMod-5.8G-160K
The RadioMod-5.8G-160K dataset is created to support research in automatic modulation recognition for UAV communication systems. It consists of 160,000 signal samples, which include 20 modulation types in the 5.8GHz frequency band. The dataset spans a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range from -18dB to 12dB. Additionally, the dataset includes UAV image transmission signals, thus expanding the available radio frequency spectrum resources for communication system analysis and signal processing tasks.

This dataset aims to provide a comprehensive resource for developing and evaluating deep learning models for signal classification in UAV communication systems. It is publicly available for download to aid in advancing the field of wireless communications.
